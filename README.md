VITE Project: 3D Visualization with Three.js and OpenJSCAD Integration
Welcome to the VITE project's repository! This project combines the power of Three.js for 3D visualization with the future development potential of OpenJSCAD for creating parametric 3D designs. This README will provide an overview of the project and guide you on how to get started.

Overview
The VITE project aims to create a web-based platform for 3D visualization and parametric design. It leverages the following technologies:

Three.js: Three.js is a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics that enables the creation of stunning 3D visualizations and interactive 3D content in the browser. In this project, Three.js is used to display and interact with 3D models.

OpenJSCAD (Future Development): OpenJSCAD is a powerful parametric 3D design tool that allows you to create complex 3D models using a scripting language. Future development of this project will integrate OpenJSCAD, enabling users to create and customize 3D models directly within the web application.

Features
Basic Three.js Integration: The project currently offers basic integration with Three.js, allowing you to view and interact with 3D models.

Future Development: Our roadmap includes the integration of OpenJSCAD, which will enable users to create and customize 3D models in a parametric and script-driven manner.

Future Development
The VITE project is an evolving initiative with exciting future developments on the horizon. Here's what we plan to do:

OpenJSCAD Integration: We are actively working on integrating OpenJSCAD into the project, allowing users to create, customize, and export parametric 3D models.

Enhanced 3D Editing: We aim to provide a user-friendly interface for editing and manipulating 3D models directly in the browser.

Community Contributions: We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help shape the project's future.
