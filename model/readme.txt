UMTRI Seated Body Shape ModelVersion 1.0.0June 18, 2018This software tool provides an interface to a parametric human body shape model. The model is based on statistical analysis of body shape data obtained from over 200 men and women in a range of seated postures.  A principal component analysis of surface vertex, landmark, and joint center locations was conducted, followed by a regression analysis predicting principal component scores from overall body dimensions and two posture measures.  The interface provides a 3D visualization of the surface prediction, along with surface landmarks and joint centers.  The outputs can be saved to a file in the polygonal PLY format (surface mesh) and text files (landmarks and joints).For more information on this model, contact Matt Reed at mreed@umich.edu or Daniel Park at keonpark@umich.edu
